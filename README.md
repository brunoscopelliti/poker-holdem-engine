# poker-holdem-engine

`poker-holdem-engine` provides an engine to play Texas Hold'em Poker in respect of the [official rules](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em).

Poker here is meant to be played by other programs, which should be listening for POST http request somewhere in the Internet, or on your localhost.

It's used as default poker holdem engine for http://botpoker.org.

## demo

It's possible to run a demo on your local machine by executing the `npm run demo` from the project root folder.

## start a tournament

```js
const Tournament = require("poker-holdem-engine");

const tournamentID = "botparty";

const players = [
  {
    id: "r2",
    name: "r2d2",
    serviceUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:8080/"
  },
  ...
];

const tournamentSettings = {
  BUYIN: 100,
  // Read docs/game-settings.md for the available configuration options.
};

const opts = {
  async onFeed (feed) {},
  async onGameComplete (chart) {},
  async onTournamentComplete (data) {},
};

const tournament = new Tournament(tournamentID, players, tournamentSettings, opts);
tournament.start();
```

Players should be object with at least the `name`, `id`, and `serviceUrl` properties specified.

On the specified end point there should be an http server, responding on the `POST /bet`, `GET /`, and `GET /version` routes.

## quit a tournament

```js
tournament.quit();
```

## prepare your player

It's possible to code your player in whatever language you want.
In the following example I will use JavaScript.

```js
// server.js

"use strict";

const player = require("./player");

const http = require("http");
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");

const app = express();
const server = http.Server(app);

app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.get("/", function (req, res) {
  res.sendStatus(200);
});

app.get("/version", function (req, res) {
  res.status(200).send(player.VERSION);
});

app.post("/bet", function (req, res) {
  res.status(200).send(String(player.bet(req.body)));
});

const port = Number.parseInt(process.env["PORT"] || 1337);

server.listen(port, function () {
  console.log("Server listening on port", server.address().port);
});
```

And the player module

```js
module.exports = {
  VERSION: "pokerstar v1",
  bet (gamestate) {
    // gamestate contains info about the state of the game;
    // currently we just fold every single hand.
    return 0;
  },
};
```
