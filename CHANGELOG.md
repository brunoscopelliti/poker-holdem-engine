* **Rule Change**:
When a player raises now the raise amount (that is the difference between the real bet, and the minimum call amount) must be a multiple of the small blind; otherwise the bet is treated as a simple call. This rule does not apply in case the player raises betting all his chips (allin); in this case every amount is considered a valid raise.
Previously every bet exceeding the call amount would have been considered a valid raise.

* Update unit tests dependency: sinon (1.17.3), tape (4.5.0).
